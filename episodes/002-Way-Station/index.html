<p>I have the Easton Press leather bound edition of Way Station as printed in the ’80s, as well as the entire 1963 run of Galaxy Magazine, including the two issues containing <em>‘Here Gather the Stars’</em>.</p>
<p>The Easton Press edition is a lovely brown leather and gilded page edges. The cover design shows the house that the majority of the novel takes place in and around. as well as a delightful rendition of some of the travelers that stopped by the Station on the inside cover pages.</p>
<p>(images incoming)</p>
<p>The two issues of Galaxy Magazine include custom illustrations on each cover that have nothing specific to do with <em>‘Here Gather the Stars’</em>, but are nonetheless gorgeous cover designs themselves.</p>

<p>This book was (surprisingly) released originally in TWO parts, published in Galaxy Magazine in 1963, under the Title ‘Here Gather the Stars’ which in my opinion is a better and more fitting name than Way Station, even though Way Station is more ‘intriguing’ and hooking as a title.</p>
<p>It has since been reprinted and translated in more than a dozen languages, and is widely considered a venerable classic among science fiction.</p>

<h2 id="spoiler-free-review"><a href="#spoiler-free-review">Spoiler FREE Review</a></h2>
<p>Way Station is generally a quiet contemplative novel about loneliness and the nature of what it means to be a human on earth. It Follows Enoch Wallace, who is the sole operator of an intergalactic travel station on Earth. Simak is the type of person who genuinely believed in the goodness of human nature and writes through a lens of compassion and generosity, so the entire book is permeated by unrelenting optimism, especially in the small details. This is a book for people that like the big questions sci-fi asks but need a break from the humbling, hopeless, and generally dire lens that those questions often get asked through in the genre. </p>
<p>Way Station does not shy away from looking directly at large issues of ableism, domestic abuse and even some political allegory while maintaining the opinion throughout that humanity is ultimately good and worthwhile. This is a classic for a reason and deserves its (somewhat forgotten) place in the annuls of history on the same bookshelf as To Kill a Mockingbird and Slaughterhouse Five.</p>

<h2 id="spoiler-filled-review"><a href="#spoiler-filled-review">Spoiler FILLED Review</a></h2>
<p>This is a story about the loneliness and solitude of Enoch Wallace in his duty to both the galaxy and to earth and humanity and non-humanity all at once. </p>
<p>To reiterate, this book is great. it stands up to inspection and re-reading extremely well and is full of the sort of nuance, criticism and subtlety that firmly place it in the Great Scifi Classic conversation. Enoch carries with him a specific note of introspection that we dont often see. He looks inside himself often and without reservation, there are no hidden dark corners of his mind that he keeps from looking directly at. He is not ashamed, or closemouthed about the war he was involved in and how that shaped him. He does not try to hide the barbarism of humanity from the aliens, even though he tries hard to avoid them seeing it, lest they think this is the only aspect of humanity. Enoch Wallace is a GOOD PERSON and Simak does an absolutely wonderful job of leading us to that conclusion throughout the book. he doesnt come out and say it, or show Enoch saving a cat, he just writes in such a way to outline the good-natured thinking and actions Enoch partakes in for the length of the novel.</p>
<p>We get to see some great Scifi tech and ideas on display, especially for 1963. for example, the ‘VR’ type simulation described in Enoch’s basement is like a perfect end goal dream VR setup. the entire room is transformed including SCENT and is indistinguishable from being physically teleported to the location, Enoch even uses his real rifle and the walls simply absorb the bullets he fires.VR without a headset is top tier, and more than a DECADE before star trek did the holodeck. </p>
<p>This book also portrays teleportation in my favorite way as well, its not an uncommon type of teleportation (though this might be among the first to think of it this way). Where the body is effectively transferred to a new location as data, rebuilt anew in that new location, and the old body is ‘disposed of’ now being effectively an empty chunk of meat. this is actually similar to the initial premise of the book im currently writing, and this type of teleportation is the only one that ever made any sort of sense to me. </p>
<p>Some of my favorite scenes in this novel are used to show different sides of Enoch, and they are all good sides. we dont get to see any ‘bad’ side of Enoch during this novel. For example, when we first meet Lucy, its clear from the get go that Lucy and Enoch have a proper companionship thats not romantic, its never even hinted that that is an option. It is just a platonic love where they clearly have affection for each other that is deep and understanding and utterly non-romantic. its a shining example of a healthy way to interact with human beings, which is a through-line of this book. Enoch treats everyone (human and non-human) with unwavering respect, and compassion. So much so that it is actually a plot point in the novel itself. There is repeated attention given to a particular grave stone and its circumstances that is sort of like checkov’s gravestone. it plays a role in the initial hook of the novel, where at the end of chapter 3 we get this gravestone as a cliffhanger, where Lewis is investigating Enoch’s property to find clues as to what is going on here and the chapter ends with ‘there were just the names and dates. On the first stone: Amanda Wallace, on the second stone: Jedediah Wallace, and on the third stone…”  which excellently draws us into the question of…WHO exactly is Enoch, is he dead? meant to be dead? what could that third stone possibly mean?? and about halfway through the book we learn that third stone is actually marked with an alien language, WHAT!? then we immediately get the backstory of what happened, where a Hazer and new/good friend of Enoch comes to the station on his travels and dies while there, and Enoch is told to handle it according to local custom, so what he does is wait all night, take the body out and bury it in his family’s plot right next to his parents because he has so much love and respect for the Hazer people and their culture and the individuals he has met over the decades. which is wonderful and brings new respect to Enoch as a character. We are meant to believe the alien writing was simply the Hazer’s name, like we might expect to find on a human gravestone. later we find out that the body has been removed from its grave, and because of that snafu the earth station is likely to be shut down, and a delegate from the hazer community is coming to issue a formal protest. while the hazer is there, Enoch respects the protest but asks that they respect the human need to ‘see for themselves’ even though the hazer’s know that that body has been moved. Enoch goes to the gravesite and the Hazer delegate asks to follow. upon seeing the gravestone and reading its inscription the Hazer is deeply moved. Enoch decides he NEEDS to get the body back and restore what is right, leading the Hazer delegate to perhaps allow this wrong to be righted at least. after the climax of the novel, we finally get this inscription deciphered for us, thus paying off the checkov’s gun. it reads “Here lies one from a distant star, but soil is not alien to him, for in death he belongs to the universe.” </p>
<p>which frankly, is just beautiful and i see why the Hazer felt like Enoch truly understood and was trying his best to pay respects to their culture and all of the galaxy at the same time. it is a gloriously written thread showcasing Enoch’s mental state throughout the grieving process and trying to navigate the intricacies of galactic cultural politics.</p>
<p>its one of literally DOZENS of glimpses in this novel that color in the shades of Enoch Wallace, and and show us that he is a good person, and the people around him are good. this novel is an essay about non-toxic humanity, but it gets into deep philosophy like we might expect from scifi as well. we get plenty of ‘what does is mean to be human?’ which is a welcome, if not common question in the genre, but we also get more esoteric points. like a metaphor for how governments should all have term limits and age limits. in Chapter 30 right after Enoch gets out of the dope ass VR simulation time he has a realization and dilemma about his ability to be the sole representative for Earth to the Galactic Confraternity. he has lived so long isolated and unaging in this station, being almost entirely separated from the human race except for a few choice friends and contacts over the years, and he feels like he CAN no longer represent the earth because of that. he says “He was a man of the 19th century, and being as such how could he possibly represent the 20th? How much does the human character change with each generation, and over a lifetime?” which is an incredibly insightful thought process and i think points to the fact that he IS a good representative for humanity. its the same as the old saying ‘the right person to be King, doesnt want the crown.’ which is heavily hinted at, and a thinly veiled allegory for the lifetime appointments of some government officials, and how the leadership of the country, and often the world, are too wealthy, spent too long separate from the struggles of the common person and is too out of touch with the population to truly be good representatives of that population.</p>
<p>Lastly toward the end of the novel, at the end of Chapter 33, we get yet another wonderful insight into human nature through the lens of Enoch Wallace Good Person (tm). Lucy’s dad Hank, who is not a very good person all told, is seen running down the hill screaming, fleeing from the light of the Talisman which is meant to bring peace and stability and clarity to everything in the galaxy. Enoch remarks ‘I am sorry we frightened him, No man should be afraid of this.” and Winslowe says ‘its himself he is afraid of, that man lives with a terror in him.” and Enoch thinks “thats the way with Man; it had always been the way. He ahd carried terror with him, and the thing he was afraid of had always been himself.” which is a kind way of stating one of the natures of abuse, but it also goes to further highlight Enoch’s separation from society. Only to the reader, and only in retrospect do we see that Enoch is set apart in this as well. We see throughout the novel that Enoch is not afraid of the unknown or of what needs doing, or addressing. its why there is no dark corners of his character and why he can and does stand up for the ‘little guy’ throughout the novel. he isnt afraid of facing things full in the face and dealing with them, which sets him apart from a large portion of human nature, but is, i think, an aspect many of us strive towards in much of our life.</p>
<p>Way Station is a wonderful novel and has much more to say than what i can cover here in a timely fashion. if you made it this far without reading it, i hope my spoilers werent too much that you dont pick this novel up, because it is truly a classic of Science Fiction and you should read it.</p>
<h3 id="criticisms"><a href="#criticisms">Criticisms</a></h3>
<p>now on to my only criticisms with this novel. they are short and simple and i wont spend much time on them, firstly, this novel can switch from a ‘matter of fact’ style of prose and structure, to a really poetic and metaphorical style rapidly, and often. which can be somewhat disorientating if youre not ready for that sort of thing. secondly, the tertiary characters just accept alien life…almost instantly without much hesitation, which is more than a little unrealistic. granted they were both sort of ‘primed’ on the fact for years now, with Winslowe getting a lot of alien wood that he says no one he asked about has ever seen before and is perfect for making things etc. And with Lewis who has spent a handful of years now hunting down this story and learning as much as he can about ‘the 130 year old who looks 35” and how his house cant be interacted with etc. so they had suspicions but when they are both faced full on with the truth of alien life, they basically never mention it or even seem bothered. its as if they both just met some guy named Bob thats a friend of Enoch’s and that was that. </p>
