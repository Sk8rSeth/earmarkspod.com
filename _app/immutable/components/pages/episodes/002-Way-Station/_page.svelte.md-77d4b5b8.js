It is just a platonic love where they clearly have affection for each other that is deep and understanding and utterly non-romantic. its a shining example of a healthy way to interact with human beings, which is a through-line of this book. Enoch treats everyone (human and non-human) with unwavering respect, and compassion. So much so that it is actually a plot point in the novel itself. There is repeated attention given to a particular grave stone and its circumstances that is sort of like checkov’s gravestone. it plays a role in the initial hook of the novel, where at the end of chapter 3 we get this gravestone as a cliffhanger, where Lewis is investigating Enoch’s property to find clues as to what is going on here and the chapter ends with ‘there were just the names and dates. On the first stone: Amanda Wallace, on the second stone: Jedediah Wallace, and on the third stone…”  which excellently draws us into the question of…WHO exactly is Enoch, is he dead? meant to be dead? what could that third stone possibly mean?? and about halfway through the book we learn that third stone is actually marked with an alien language, WHAT!? then we immediately get the backstory of what happened, where a Hazer and new/good friend of Enoch comes to the station on his travels and dies while there, and Enoch is told to handle it according to local custom, so what he does is wait all night, take the body out and bury it in his family’s plot right next to his parents because he has so much love and respect for the Hazer people and their culture and the individuals he has met over the decades. which is wonderful and brings new respect to Enoch as a character. We are meant to believe the alien writing was simply the Hazer’s name, like we might expect to find on a human gravestone. later we find out that the body has been removed from its grave, and because of that snafu the earth station is likely to be shut down, and a delegate from the hazer community is coming to issue a formal protest. while the hazer is there, Enoch respects the protest but asks that they respect the human need to ‘see for themselves’ even though the hazer’s know that that body has been moved. Enoch goes to the gravesite and the Hazer delegate asks to follow. upon seeing the gravestone and reading its inscription the Hazer is deeply moved. Enoch decides he NEEDS to get the body back and restore what is right, leading the Hazer delegate to perhaps allow this wrong to be righted at least. after the climax of the novel, we finally get this inscription deciphered for us, thus paying off the checkov’s gun. it reads “Here lies one from a distant star, but soil is not alien to him, for in death he belongs to the universe.”"),Le=d(),U=n("p"),_t=r("which frankly, is just beautiful and i see why the Hazer felt like Enoch truly understood and was trying his best to pay respects to their culture and all of the galaxy at the same time. it is a gloriously written thread showcasing Enoch’s mental state throughout the grieving process and trying to navigate the intricacies of galactic cultural politics."),Re=d(),Y=n("p"),St=r("its one of literally DOZENS of glimpses in this novel that color in the shades of Enoch Wallace, and and show us that he is a good person, and the people around him are good. this novel is an essay about non-toxic humanity, but it gets into deep philosophy like we might expect from scifi as well. we get plenty of ‘what does is mean to be human?’ which is a welcome, if not common question in the genre, but we also get more esoteric points. like a metaphor for how governments should all have term limits and age limits. in Chapter 30 right after Enoch gets out of the dope ass VR simulation time he has a realization and dilemma about his ability to be the sole representative for Earth to the Galactic Confraternity. he has lived so long isolated and unaging in this station, being almost entirely separated from the human race except for a few choice friends and contacts over the years, and he feels like he CAN no longer represent the earth because of that. he says “He was a man of the 19th century, and being as such how could he possibly represent the 20th? How much does the human character change with each generation, and over a lifetime?” which is an incredibly insightful thought process and i think points to the fact that he IS a good representative for humanity. its the same as the old saying ‘the right person to be King, doesnt want the crown.’ which is heavily hinted at, and a thinly veiled allegory for the lifetime appointments of some government officials, and how the leadership of the country, and often the world, are too wealthy, spent too long separate from the struggles of the common person and is too out of touch with the population to truly be good representatives of that population."),$e=d(),Q=n("p"),Ht=r("Lastly toward the end of the novel, at the end of Chapter 33, we get yet another wonderful insight into human nature through the lens of Enoch Wallace Good Person (tm).
