## A Brief History
- A Fall of Moondust was nominated for a hugo award, as an honorable mention in the 1962 hugo awards, and as a finalist in the 1963 hugo awards, but lost
- It had a radio drama adaptation on BBC Radio, released in 1981. (I desperately need to hear this)
- the vast majority of its prints and translation prints were in the 1980's.
- This novel voiced a major fear and uncertainty about the unknowns of landing on the moon at the time, almost a decade before we actually did it for the first time. we did not know if the moon was solid enough to land on at all, or if Buzz and Neil would simply sink into it like in the novel. we had a pretty good idea it would be fine (obviously hence why we sent people) but it was still uncertain even when Apollo 11 launched.

## Spoiler FREE Review
A Fall of Moondust is a joy of a book, feels like a subtle mix between the Martian and 12 Angry Men. It follows a small voyage cruise aboard the Lunar Dust-Cruiser Selene on a sea of regolith named the Sea of Thirst. Drama ensues with and to the small party onboard and they must get to know each other, and work together to overcome the situation. Which sounds generic, and from a 10000ft view, it might be, but thats part of what makes this books such a wonderful read. its a 'small scope' story. it doesnt span lightyears or decades. its a small group, on a small boat, with high stakes to them, not the universe. 
With every descriptor and line of dialog it is clear this is a work by Arthur C. Clarke, his narrative voice is absolutely crystalline in all his works, and might as well be a tuning fork with how easy it is to discern. It is also clear that this is a book written before the moon landings. some of the ideas postulated by Clarke are uncanny in their accuracy for a modern post-space society, and some of them are quaint and adorable, which we will discuss more in the spoiler section of this review. suffice it to say if you want to stop now and read this book before i get into spoilers, i can highly recommend it. its the perfect book for when you need a small story. i found it absolutely lovely in between giant fantasy epic series, as a sort of palette cleanser.

## Spoiler FILLED Review
Onto the spoiler filled review portion, final warning.
I find that this book is exactly what i need when i find myself overwhelmed or burnt out, or just too tired to emotionally deal with the intensity of other more modern books. As the crew and passengers find themselves stranded beneath the regolith, the stakes are incredibly high for them but the intensity is not high for us, the readers. i love that. i get really anxious sometimes when im reading other stories and people are dying and the last life boat gets blown up and all that sort of drama. But here, the drama is well written but not as intense, which is a rarity. for example, part way through the story they begin building up the 'weird and silent new zealander' who the captain and commodore have identified as potentially troublesome. when that bomb finally lands, its not that he is someone who has cracked and decided to sabotage the ship's repair efforts or kill everyone onboard or anything. its that he is convinced this whole thing is his fault because aliens are after him. he is a deep conspiracy theorist and believes this is aliens stopping him from finding some secret he was nearing. thats good drama, but its medium intensity at best, this book was like a breath of air in the extreme drama of a lot of scifi books.
In the end, they all get out alive and well, putting this traumatic and harrowing experience behind them, just like regular people would. they survived a vacation catastrophe and moved on,. Which is utterly delightful to read, as macabre as that sounds. Clarke has a way with his narrative to make the story feel good, worthwhile and dramatic without needing to resort to the a lot of what I now feel is cliche. Thats exactly why i was expecting that person to start killing or exploding things, instead of the more obvious reality-facing thing that he is just a conspiracy theorist, like you would find on a public bus instead of an intergalactic super villain. This book's happy ending is also well deserved, these people fought and sacrificed and survived and we DONT get the rug pulled out from under us after that, like i would expect (and did expect here) in a modern novel. I relished the epilogue even more so because i did expect the rug to be pulled out and for Captain Pat to die saving the others, but instead he makes it out alive. He uses the realization of his love for Sue Wilkins, the stewardess, to help move on with his life, marry her and start to have children. He begins training a replacement captain for the cruise voyage so he can retire, and makes on last trip on the Sea of Thirst to officially commemorate and handoff that duty, and STILL he makes it out just fine, with nary a sentence about the voyage other than to say it was good to be back on last time before saying goodbye forever.
I felt that the characters were all very well thought out, and fleshed out, even though we dont spend much time with each of them individually aside from Commodore Hansteen, Captain Pat Harris, Sue Wilkins (the stewardess) and Aboriginal Australian Physicist Duncan McKenzie. each of whom was fascinating to learn about. Pat and Duncan have a fascinating conversation about his aboriginal heritage and how he feels about the 'white settlers' of australia sort of taking over the and mostly destroying their ways in an effort to 'modernize the savages'. and that conversation is treated delicately, and with wonderful tact. when that convo started i began to sort of cringe, probably out of habit from being on the internet so long, but it turned out to be lovely and informative and interesting with no sense of BS. Commodore Hansteen as well is a retired SUPERSTAR of the universe basically, stepping on tons of planets and leading the first ever expedition to Pluto. He has lead a storied and full career and has since retired. He is traveling under an alias and has shaved his iconic beard which is why no one noticed him onboard or on the manifest until the accident occurred and he had to 'come clean' and work ALONGSIDE Pat Harris to command the situation and help keep the passengers from panic, all the while making sure not to overshadow Pat's captain-age and undermine his authority. 
There is also a delightful amount 'clearly 1960s ideas' which are great contrast to some of the ideas in the same chapters that are so modern its crazy. for example, the electric and liquid oxygen fueled Selene ship, is full of really modern ideas about how vehicles will work in the 'future' (ie right about now) but also all information is sent via a 'telephone-like' system and printed out. so the ship is waiting on a passenger manifest to be sent over so they can verify who is on board, but instead of just showing the list on screen, it has to be printed and read by someone else, who then informs the base commander. there are more obvious things as well, like an entire crate of cigarettes being on board alongside the food rations etc, but there are also much more modern ideas too, like a scientist hosting a 'talk/debate' show online from the moon, debunking and arguing with audience members on earth about possible solutions to get Selene out of the crater. its a delightful mix of old-timey and very modern that can only come out of top tier mid-century sci-fi.

i will continue to pull this book out occasionally when i need a break and a breather, and an unabashedly happy ending with no caveats. Just good clean hard scifi drama, which is a highlight to why Arthur C. Clarke is a master. 

### Criticisms

the only criticism I really have with this novel is it sometimes lingers a little too long on weird dead ends in the narrative, in an effort to build out the world.
